### Machine Learning

#### [Predicting Weather with Machine Learning](https://github.com/anjaalsen/ClimateWins-insights-python)

This project explores how machine learning can support small organizations in analyzing complex climate patterns for adaptation.
Using historical weather data from 18 European stations (1960–2022), I examined links between sunshine, temperature, precipitation, and "pleasant weather."

I used K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Artificial Neural Networks to classify conditions, applying preprocessing like scaling, feature selection, and tuning. Performance was assessed with confusion matrices and accuracy scores.

#### [Analyzing Global Internet Adoption with Regression, Clustering & Time Series Methods](https://github.com/anjaalsen/Digital-Divide-insights-python)

This project analyzes the relationship between internet adoption and economic development using World Bank data (1960–2022) and geo-referenced country data. It combines Python for statistical analysis and Tableau for interactive visualization.

Using pandas and seaborn, I explored trends and correlations. Linear regression analyzed GDP’s impact on internet use, K-means clustering grouped countries by economic and digital factors, and time series analysis assessed long-term internet adoption trends.

### SQL

#### [SQL Analysis for Online Video Rental Market Strategy](https://github.com/anjaalsen/Rockbuster-insights-sql)

This project uses SQL and PostgreSQL to analyze movie rental data in support of a digital launch strategy. By examining rental durations, genre profitability, customer distribution, and regional revenues, the analysis provides data-driven insights to inform business decisions in a competitive online video rental market.
