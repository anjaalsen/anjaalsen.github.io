[ClimateWins: Predicting Pleasant Weather with Machine Learning](https://github.com/anjaalsen/ClimateWins-insights-python)
<p style="font-size:12px">As part of the NGO ClimateWins, this project explores how machine learning can help small organizations analyze complex climate patterns and support climate adaptation. Using historical weather data from 18 European stations (1960â€“2022), we tested the link between sunshine, temperature, precipitation, and "pleasant weather."  
We applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to classify weather conditions, with preprocessing steps like scaling, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Performance was evaluated using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.

[Uncovering Digital Inequality with Machine Learning & Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/anjaalsen/Digital-Divide-insights-python)
<p style="font-size:12px">This project applies a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear regression, unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering), and time series analysis to uncover trends and segment patterns in global internet adoption from 1960 to 2022.
The analysis is built on 20 datasets from the World Bank (economic, demographic, educational, and infrastructure indicators), enriched with geographic data from Natural Earth. All preprocessing (e.g., scaling, missing value imputation, normalization) and modeling were performed in Python, with final results visualized in an interactive Tableau dashboard.
